# Manga Bubble Shaper

The Manga Bubble Shaper is a script designed to aid the comic lettering process in Adobe Photoshop. Its main goal is to set a baseline bubble shape to text by adding line breaks (`\n`) to the current selected text layer in Photoshop. The script should not be treated as a be-all end-all solution for text shaping but rather as a guide.

Please note that the script also adds extra whitespace to lines that end or start with an ellipsis.

## Usage

1. Open Adobe Photoshop.
2. Select the text layer you want to shape.
3. Run the Manga Bubble Shaper script via ```File > Scripts```.
4. The script will automatically add line breaks to the selected text layer, shaping it into a baseline bubble shape.

## Limitations

- The script is not a comprehensive solution for text shaping and may require manual adjustments.
- It may not handle all text scenarios perfectly and may not produce desired results in certain cases.
- Users should use the script as a guide and make further adjustments as needed.
